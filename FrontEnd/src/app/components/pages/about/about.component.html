      This is a Powerful Budgeting app built by
      <a href="https://www.jack-kawell.com" target="_blank">Jack Kawell</a>. The
      frontend is built with Angular and the backend consists of a webserver
      written with Node.js and a database running on Postgres. The whole thing is
      hosted in a Docker microservices fleet.
